# Docker Image Management

Docker provides a public/default registry where users and companies can publish their builded
images to.
However one can deploy it cutom registry where it images are located.

To search for docker images(verified, published by users, etc...), we can go to docker hub which
is the default docker images registry.

Alternatively, docker cli provides command to search images from terminal as follow:

> docker search [--filter stars=n is-official=<bool>] [--limit n] <IMAGE>

Once an image is found, and one needs to download the image, simply do:

> docker pull <IMAGE>
> docker pull <REGISTRY>/<Repository>/<ImageName>

An example will be:

> docker pull grc.io/httpd/httpd # Where grc.io is the google cloud registry

## Authenticating with registries

> docker login -u <Username> -p
> docker login <Username>

## Creating a soft link to an image

> docker image tag <Image>:tag <Image2>:tag

## Inspecting docker images

> docker image history <ImageName>                      # Shows the dockerfile directives used in building the image
> docker image inspect <ImageName> -f '{{.Os}}'         # Uses json path search to query for value of Os property

# Creating tarball from docker image

> docker image save <Image>[:tag] -o <Path/To/Tarball.tar>

To load an image from the created tarball:

> docker image load -i <Path/To/Tarball.tar> # This will 

To create an image from an existing container:

> docker export <ContainerName> > <Path/To/Tarball.tar> # Create a tarball from a docker container

To load the tarball into an image:

> docker image import <Path/To/Tarball.tar> <ImageName>[:tag]

## Using docker commit to create image from container state

> docker container commit [-a <Author>] [-c <DockerFileForAdditionalInstruction>] [-m <Commit Message>] <ContainerName> <NewImageName> # Create an image from existing container

**Note** This approach is not a recommended approach, one should use the `Dockerfile` to build an image.


## Best practices

- Cache busting

It's a technique in which package update and install instruction are concatenated in a single instruction
using `&` symbol, so that docker always update packages repository before installing them.
Them allow the image to always have use up to date version of packages.

- Copy VS ADD

It's recommended to use `copy` when copying file from host to container.

**Note** ADD will download files when url is specified, extract tarball content to container if 
         tarball is provided.

> COPY [--from=<IMAGE>] <SOURCE> <DESTINATION>

## BASH vs Entrypoint

Entrypoint instruction is like command instruction, but with ability to accept argument when the container
runner is invoked.

In case of CMD, the default command is replace by the argument to the run script.

## Base vs Parent Image

In docker hierarchy, one can have only on on base image which is build from `scratch (which is the nothing)` 
but can have one or multiple parent in the hierarchy.

**Note** `scratch` is the docker minimum image from which image must be built.


## Useful commands

> docker image ps       # List image on a docker host
> docker ls --no-trunc  # List images on a docker host without triming image id
> docker list           # List images on a docker host
