# Linux Networking

**Note** Linux Kernel (Core system) handles Layer2, Layer3, Layer4 of the OSI model.

**Note** In Linux networking, if a given network namespace does not have a default gateway,
         one will not be able to connect to anything.

## Ip (layer 2 (Data Link) of OSI model)

**Note** List of possible options are:

- br         # Print a brief Layer2, and Layer3 information about NIC.
- c          # Add color to hightlighed information
- j [-p]     # Output network interface information in json format. `-p` for prettifying.
- online|o   # Online output
- 4          # Return ip version 4 addresses
- 6          # Return ip version 6 addresses

--- Layer 2 (Data Link) is the connection between wire and NIC.
--- MAC (Physical address) - Static Hexadecimal value built into device that is manufacturer dependent

It's part of the `iproute2` package which is a collection of utilities
for controlling `TCP/IP` networking and traffic control.

`ip` command replace deprecated networking tools like `ifconfig`, `route`,
`arp` etc...

> man ip [| less ] # show manual page of the ip utility command

> ip link|l [show] # show network interfaces on a linux host

### Address object (Network layer & Data Link Layer)

`addr` object allow users to display layer 2 and layer 3 (ipv4, ipv6, etc...) information
of linux network interfaces.

> ip addr|address [show]

**Note** `inet` stand for internet address or ip adress of the network interface.

> ip addr add <CIDR_ADDRESS> [dev <NetworkInterface>]

```sh
ip addr add 10.0.01/24 dev eth0
```

> ip addr del <CIDR_ADDRESS> [dev <NetworkInterface>] # Delete network ip address


> ip -br -c addr show
> ip -o addr | awk '{print $4}'  # Show ip address that is the 4th element in oneline output

## Route

Show ip routing information (like gateway, device, metric, etc) to other network interface.

> ip [OPTIONS] r|route # Display routing information

> ip r|route delete <GATEWAY_OR_ROUTING_TABLE_NAME> # Delete a routing gateway for a given network namespace

> ip [OPTIONS] r|route add [<GATEWAY_OR_ROUTING_TABLE_NAME>] <IP_ADDR_OR_GATEWAY> [dev <NETWORK_DEVICE_INTERFACE>]
    # Add a network gateway in a given network namespace. `dev` object is used to specify the network device
    # on which gateway is added

> ip route add default 192.168.12.1 dev en0 # Add a default gateway to en0 interface
